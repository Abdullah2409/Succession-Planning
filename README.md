## Importance of Pre-Existing Data

# It is crucial for HR to upload data into the database before users can sign up. This pre-existing data includes both employers and employees. It is required for the signup process to work correctly, as users need to select an employer during the signup process.

# Having this data populated ensures that the Kiya app functions correctly and that users can sign up and access the platform with the correct permissions and access levels.
